# Execution

```
make all
./setup_rocksdb
```

The scripts assume that the rocksdb source is available at ```~/rocksdb```



## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb.git
cd rocksdb/
make all
make install
```

Ubuntu might need other dependecies. [This](https://gist.github.com/diegopacheco/e8ccd6e719628e30a2ad0de3cc60234c) might be helpful.
